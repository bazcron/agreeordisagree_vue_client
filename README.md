Agree or Disagree web App

Created the client side of this web app.

Functionality:

Decided to change it from my previous idea and added a function where the user could add their own Statement.

I added 2 extra columns, Agree or Disagree Columns. If a user clicks on these the values for Agreed or Disagreed go up.

Users are shown Statements they can Agree or Disagree with each statement.

There is also a Admin Button. Clicking on this you will be asked to enter the password. If the password is correct 2 extra columns are displayed.. Edit and Delete.

Clicking Delete brings up another pop up box asking to confirm.

Clicking on Edit, brings you to another screen where the data from that statement are displayed. Unfortunately the save function is not working correctly.

Server Side Functionality:

The Statements are returned and displayed to the user.
